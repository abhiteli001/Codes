# GETMART is a Online Store, which proceeds with the user inputs #
# Code Proceeds by giving 3 options , 1.shopping ,2.to view the cart, 3.to exit the store#
# Option 1 -- Shopping ,you will be prompted to input the customer id , wrt to customer the items will be added in list
#             if you try to add the items not present in the store, the code checks if item is available in the near by
#             store, for example try putting "Chocolate" or "Noodles"
# Option 2 -- View Cart , you will be prompted to input the customer id again, if same id is input as in option 1,
#             it will provide the Shopping list of the Customer who is indicated by Cust ID
#             Further options will be prompted as the code continues in Option 2
# Option 3 -- Does nothing , simply asks for the Customer ID and exits printing Thank you message wrt Customer ID
#
# The Entire code is run in while loop , to keep asking for repeated inputs.
#
# Please NOTE : I have added two Customer ID "123" and "145" default Address to show the address input is given
#               other than given Customer IDs , the code asks for address input.
#
# Hope you enjoy the Code!!! Thank you for your time :).
